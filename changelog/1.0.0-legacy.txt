// WARNING
If you curious about this release major issues, there is list of known problems:
    VERY fast mob spawnrate without any restrictions. In simple terms - your fps gonna be below 0    
    No features from newer versions (duh)
    No support or maintance
    ...and everything else that I personally don't like (specifially textures)
